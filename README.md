# Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?
    MaxEventTracker is a user-centric app meticulously designed to simplify event management for all types of users, including students, professionals, and families. It allows users to log in, create, edit, and delete events, ensuring they stay on top of their schedules. The vibrant green neon app icon, featuring double M'Es, is not just a design choice but a symbol of our commitment to user engagement and a modern look.

   
# What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?
    My design, which included a login screen, a data display screen, and an SMS screen, was a resounding success. Each screen was equipped with features that catered to user inputs, such as the data screen's grid that displayed essential dates and news. The SMS screen was designed with a logic that responded to user inputs. This successful Design was not only spotless but also met the UI needs of our users without overwhelming the screens. 

# How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those techniques or strategies be applied in the future?
    The approach I took was designing first. I then was able to break the project down into smaller pieces. This was an iterative development approach that included regular testing and debugging of the code. Version control was used to make code changes. These techniques ensured the project was built correctly. In future projects, I plan to use the same strategy, which will ensure the highest standard of code. 

# How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important, and what did it reveal?
    I tested my code many times to ensure it was functional. This included unit testing to ensure all the components and functions worked together. The test is crucial because it ensures the app is bug-free and finds areas for improvement. This is very important to ensure the UI is user-friendly and works smoothly. 

# Consider the full app design and development process from initial planning to finalization. Where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?
    The only challenge I faced was when creating the SQLite database. I overcame this challeege by watching youtube videos and taking my time when building the project

# In what specific component of your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?
    One place where I was very successful was when creating the login screen and authentication system. By going into the user needs and using my coding strategies, I overcame challenges and created a user-friendly application.
